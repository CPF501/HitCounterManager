# HitCounterManager
Manages a hit counter  

## Features
It was designed for Dark Souls III 0 hit runs, to count every hit during the playthrough
* Creates a HTML file of the hit counts (can be used by CLR browser plugin in Open BroadCaster Software in order to make it visible on stream)
* Instead of using GUI buttons, keyboard shortcuts can be configured:
  * Increase hit count of the current split
  * Reset the run (set all hit counts to 0 and select first split)
  * Select next split
* Keyboard shortcuts are working in fullscreen applications (like Dark Souls III)
* Via GUI every value can be changed at any time
* Multiple profiles can be created (e.g. "Any%", "AllBosses", "DLC only"..)
* Switching to other profiles will keep hit counts of currently selected profile
* Button to save current run as PB (personal best)
* Comes with sample profile: Dark Souls III 0 Hit All Bosses Vanilla

## Get the software
Checkout the [Releases] (https://github.com/topeterk/HitCounterManager/releases) section and choose the version of you choice.

## Installation
The installer places the executable and an inital configuration file at your installation folder (default: Program Files).  
It additionally places a template and HTML file at %localappdata%\HitCounterManager.  
During execution a further configuration file will be stored under %localappdata%\HitCounterManager.

### Configuring CLR browser plugin for OBS
By know I created a 400 to 800 pixel wide window and run it with 3 FPS.  
The HTML will be re-generated by this application when anything changes, so usually it should not change very often. If you are using the pre-created HitCounter.template, the CLR browser is going to re-load the HTML file on every second, so it is recommended to set FPS to a lower number, like 3.  
The opacity can be set to 100% because the background will be rendered transparent, so no color-keying is involved.  
Since CRL browser plugin come with some pre-defined CSS, this may cause trouble with the rendering of the HTML file (flickering or misplacement). To get rid of that simple remove the CLR browser plugin's CSS overrides.

### Changing layout and design
You can modify the [HitCounter.template] (HitCounter.template) which comes with the installation or you can create a own HTML template file to get the look you want.  
The application is using JavaScript to write the data into the HTML table. For that the template have to have a line with the text **HITCOUNTER_LIST_START** which is the starting mark. The mark with all further lines will be replaced with the JavaScript equivalent of the application's current data. This happens until the **HITCOUNTER_LIST_END** text mark is reached.
This way you are 100% free in the design of your hit counter.
